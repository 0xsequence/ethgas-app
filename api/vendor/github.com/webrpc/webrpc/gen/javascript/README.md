webrpc Javascript (ES6) generator
=================================

> NOTE: the javascript generator is almost identical to the typescript one,

> and just relied on `tsc` to compile to es5/es6 JS versions, but
> for ease of use for devs that don't use TS, we offer this generator.

This generator, from a webrpc schema/design file will code-generate:

1. Client -- an isomorphic/universal Javascript client to speak to a webrpc server using the
provided schema. This client is compatible with any webrpc server language (ie. Go, nodejs, etc.).
As the client is isomorphic, means you can use this within a Web browser or use the client in a 
server like nodejs -- both without needing any dependencies. I suggest to read the generated TS
output of the generated code, and you shall see, its nothing fancy, just the sort of thing you'd
write by hand.

2. Server -- a nodejs Javascript server handler. See examples.


## webrpc-gen extras

The `webrpc-gen` tool accepts an `-extra` cli flag, which is passed down to the generator, and
we use it for some basic toggling during code-generation. For `javascript` generator, we make
es6 code that includes module "exports" by default, but, if you'd like to use the client in a
UMD scenario without having to use babel or something like it, you can pass `-extra=noexports`
option to the cli.. like we do in the [hello-webrpc](../../_examples/hello-webrpc) example. 

ie..

```
webrpc-gen -schema=hello-api.webrpc.json -target=js -extra=noexports -client -out=./webapp/client.gen.js
```
